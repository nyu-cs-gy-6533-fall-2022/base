This assignment accounts for 25\% of your final grade. You can win 15\% of extra credit on this assignment based on the originality and complexity of your project.

## Goals

This is the final project of the class. You are free to decide what you want to work on, as long as it follows the guidelines below.

## Submission

*	Follow the link (see discord channel) to create your repository.

*	Add a README.md in markdown format as a report of what you did and add screenshots to document your results.

*	Push the code into the repository before deadline

## Project Guidelines

You have to prepare a 1-2-page overview of your project, detailing what you want to do and what the relation with the topics learned in this class is. This document (PDF or markdown) has to be pushed to your repository by the first deadline (11/17/22) and will be approved by Tuesday, November 22, 2022. Your proposal should split the project into tasks and include a suggested grading (this might be adapted by the instructors). Feel free to include bonus points (see above: up to 15% extra credit); however, extra credit might also be awarded based on the quality of the final result.

*Let us know if you submit your project description early, you might be able to get a pre-approval!*

*You can contact the instructors if you want feedback on your project idea.*

**You can work on the project in small teams of up to 3 people, but:**

* the proposed amount of work has to be appropriate for the size of the team
* each team member will be graded individually, that is, the proposal must include a plan how the work will be distributed, and it needs to be clear what the contributions of each team member was (e.g., comments in the code, GitHub commits, etc.)

### Grading ###

The final project will be graded depending on the correctness and completeness of the graphics part of the project (wrt your project proposal). As mentioned above, you have to briefly present the results of your project in class on Dec 14.

### Software Libraries ###

You are free to use any software library you want if it is detailed in the project description and approved by the instructors. However, if you choose to use external libraries, the amount of work you do yourself still has to be sufficiently high (i.e., we expect more advanced graphics / methods if you use libraries).
